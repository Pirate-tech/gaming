        <h1 align="center">PC Game</h1>
        <p>A PC game, also known as a computer game or personal computer game, is a type of video game played on a
            personal
            computer rather than a video game console or arcade machine. Its defining characteristics include: more
            diverse
            and user-determined gaming hardware and software; and generally greater capacity in input, processing, video
            and
            audio output. The uncoordinated nature of the PC game market, and now its lack of physical media, make
            precisely
            assessing its size difficult.

            Home computer games became popular following the video game crash of 1983, leading to the era of the
            "bedroom
            coder". In the 1990s, PC games lost mass-market traction to console games, before enjoying a resurgence in
            the
            mid-2000s through digital distribution.

            Newzoo reports that the PC gaming sector is the third-largest category (and estimated in decline) across all
            platforms as of 2016, with the console sector second-largest, and mobile/smartphone gaming sector biggest.
            2.2
            billion video gamers generate US$101.1 billion in revenue, excluding hardware costs. "Digital game revenues
            will
            account for $94.4 billion or 87% of the global market. Mobile is the most lucrative segment, with smartphone
            and
            tablet gaming growing 19% year on year to $46.1 billion, claiming 42% of the market. In 2020, mobile gaming
            will
            represent just more than half of the total games market. China expected to generate $27.5 billion, or
            one-quarter of all revenues in 2017.</p>

        <h1 align="center">The Best PC Game Game</h1>
        <p>The best PC game in the world is The Witcher. what people say about this game is-<br>jospeh Keane, Played
            and
            read most of the series<br> S6765757578

            Graphics:

            Graphics don’t make a game, but they certainly don’t hurt it. The incredible graphics, sunshine and
            style is in
            sync with the game, making it feel as though you are in the universe. The placement of props really
            brings you
            into the game as you see the world as it is rather than a pale reflection.

            Weapons:

            Most games have a plethora of weapons, while the Witcher 3 is limited only to a sword, a silver sword, a
            crossbow and magic - And even a limited selection of magic. This seems like a bad thing - more weapon
            types are
            good, right? But in fact, this forces you into the style of the Witcher, and you become expert in this
            fighting
            style. It also puts an even ground as there is no such thing as a worse weapon type - each caters to
            it’s own
            enemy. You become less concerned with your weapons and more so with your fighting ability.

            Open World:

            It is far from the first to do it, but it does it one of the best. Instead of one giant open world, it
            has
            smaller ones representing different locations. This seems bad, but in fact it shows how big the world is
            - if
            you spend ages trying to get somewhere that’s only a cm away on the map, it must be big. It was well
            made so you
            rarely if ever reach the edge of the map, and is giant such that anywhere you go will find a cave,
            enemies or
            something. And this is all in one map rather than seperated by loading screens. You can immediately go
            anywhere,
            but are limited instead by whether your level is high enough to defeat enemies you find there. On that…

            Levels:

            Like many games, The Witcher 3 uses a level system. This mostly works as enemies do NOT scale, so you’re
            encouraged to level up before chasing certain quests, keeping the story advancing too fast.

            Enemies:

            The enemies in the game are amazing. There are a set number of specific monsters, all based off the
            series. They
            all have specific weaknesses, encouuraging you to vary your magic, oil and bombs depending on the enemy.
            Some
            need to be trapped in order to defeat, while others you just have to keep dodging because any one hit
            will bring
            you down. The variety of enemies keeps it fun, needing to continually vary strategy.

            Fighting:

            Swordplay is done incredibly in the game. It’s simple - left click to strike, right click to block, but
            gives
            bonuses for timing. More importantly, you can roll and dodge. While most games have you clicking as
            quick as
            possible to hit the enemy, this becomes more of a dance, and is much more realistic. Instead of taking
            hits, you
            dodge. Hit, dodge, hit dodge. This makes even hard fights more manageable as you can defend simply by
            not
            getting hit. Along with the crossbow for flying and underwater, and bombs, fighting becomes very
            enjoyable.

            Magic:

            Magic signs are also a great part of combat and the game. Aard acts as a force and can push enemies back
            or stun
            them briefly. Igni stikes with fire, burning them. Yrden slows opponents, making them easier to hit.
            Quen acts
            as a shield, protecting you when you need defence. Axii can sway people, stunning them, making them
            fight for
            you, calming your horse or persuade people to do what you will. These signs are all very different,
            working
            great depending on the situation. Again, the player is needing to play a variety of these tactics in
            order to
            defeat the enemy. And some are useful outside combat too, making them more so interesting and fun.

            Upgrades:

            As you level, you get upgrades to purchase as well as mutagens from killing enemies. What makes these
            special is
            that the best are not neccesarily at the end, and you can’t use all the ones purchaced at once. This
            makes you
            think about the ones you choose and pick ones that work together. Also they are typically not
            overpowered, still
            needing multiple attack styles to stand a chance against all opponents.

            Gwent:

            This minigame is pure gold. It is optional, but on getting a deck by playing to win cards, you can play
            and win
            this incredible game. It is fun, requires strategy, and can make you more excited to play this than the
            main
            game. The addition of this to the main game is a great one, supplementing normal gameplay and giving you
            a sense
            of achievement when you win.

            Novigrad:

            Novigrad is incredible, and one of the only two only cities seen in the main game. It is a hallmark of
            what
            cities should be in games, putting others like Solitude in Skyrim to shame. It has divisions between
            rich and
            poor, a river, and is gigantic, meaning you can complete all the quests there and still be lost. It
            feels really
            like a city putting you right into the game as you explore it. You really are in Novigrad - not simply
            playing a
            game.

            Quests, Choice and Consequence:

            All the quests are incredible. None are simply grind quests (except maybe scavenger hunts), meaning
            there is an
            interwoven story between all of them. More importantly, most side quests have options. You can choose
            whether to
            spare or kill the monster. This along with excellent dynamic dialogue means your choices can really
            change lots
            of things, and has a real impact on the game. When somebody dies, the chances are it was avoidable. This
            makes
            it all the more emotional as you can actually affect the outcome and are therefore potentially at fault.

            Characters:

            The characters are the best thing about this game. In most games, characters are 2D, simply there to
            fill the
            world and give you quests. Not here. Each character is excellently described. You actually become
            friends with
            them, and feel you are helping them in a situation rather than just getting XP. You spend a lot of time
            with the
            characters themselves - in fact in one quest you even spend the night drinking with your fellow
            Witchers,
            telling stories and having fun. You’re not simply a cold mercenary - you can experience live in the
            world just
            as much. And you build a close relation to them as you spend time alongside them - especially Yennefer
            and Ciri.

            YOU ARE THE WITCHER:

            Summing up all the limitations on combat and relationships - when playing, most of all, you feel like
            the
            Witcher. You do everything he does, you hear him speak as you talk, you grow to learn him as you fight
            as him.
            The special thing is you are not yourself. You are watching the story unfold as the Witcher himself. And
            that is
            something special. To put yourself in his shoes and be him. That is truely what makes it a good game.

            BONUS - DLC:

            DLC isn’t part of the main game, so technically doesn’t affect whether it’s a good game, but it is
            amazing.
            Hearts of Stone offers a compelling story with some extra features, while Blood and Wine is the best DLC
            to ever
            exist in this world, finishing the story, adding new stuff and having so many new stuff in a compelling
            different world that it is the perfect end to the series, even better so than most of the main game in
            my
            opinion.

            The one flaw in the game is it is quite slow before you find Dandilion, simply needing to find person
            after
            person, but after it quickly picks up to an incredible conclution.

            All this makes it a good game, well deserving of Game of the Century.</p>
        <p>Tk Yashwanth, Dabbed ingame for 200 hours and on my way to read all books<br> What makes the Witcher 3
            really
            special is how it manages to stir up your emotions, once you complete the game, you will most definitely
            think “Damn, I can never play it for the first time again”. The side quests, the characters you meet,
            every
            single person in the Witcher world is unique and will leave an impression on you. Off the top of my
            head,
            there one guy, a farmer who stays alone in his hut with nothing but fog around him. You can choose to
            help
            him or not, through him I learnt you must always do things without any slack no matter the
            circumstances.
            The game will make you a better person, it did for me. Other than this, the landscapes, the atmosphere,
            the
            music, the dialogue, each and every quest, the expansions which are truly amazing, Touissant and most
            importantly Gwent. And I probably forgot the brief part of a quest where you travel through time. All
            this
            makes the Witcher 3 a truly special game. Enjoy the game, it truly one of a kind. <a
