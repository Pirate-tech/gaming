        <p>Playstation is a video game console developed by Sony. The first Playstation was released in 1994, followed
            by
            Playstation 2 (PS2) in 2000 and Playstation 3 (PS3) in 2006. ... PS2 represented another leap in processing
            power and game play at its introduction with a CPU capable of 66 million polygons per second.

        <h1 align="center">Which play station is best?</h1>
        <p>The PlayStation 4 Pro is the best version of the most popular game platform available today. With 4K, HDR 10
            compatibility, and the PlayStation 4â€™s exclusive game library, it is currently the best plug-and-play gaming
            platform.

            A very large majority of both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One libraries are available on both platforms.
            Though
            both platforms have popular exclusive franchises, the PlayStation 4 (Pro or standard) sees more exclusive
            games
            each year. The PS4 also has access to a small number of less well-known indie games and niche titles, such
            as
            Japanese role-playing games, that the Xbox One does not.

        <h1 align="center">which X Box is best?</h1>
        <p>If you're the type of console gamer who buys all the latest, biggest games and wants the best visual
            experience
            possible, the Xbox One X with a 4K TV is the best option by far this year. If you're a content creator, the
            Xbox
            One X will provide you with 4K video clips and screenshots as a bonus.Dec 2, 2019</p>

        <h1 align="center">Which is best Play Station or XBox?</h1>
        <p>Overall Winner: PlayStation 4
            Sony has shown stronger support for independent developers so far, and both the current and future game
            lineups
            look better for PS4 than for Xbox One. Most AAA games these days are released for both consoles, but the
            PS4's
            list of exclusives easily trumps the Xbox's.</p>
