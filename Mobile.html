        <p>A mobile game is a game played on a feature phone, smartphone/tablet, smartwatch, PDA, portable media player
            or
            graphing calculator. The earliest known game on a mobile phone was a Tetris variant on the Hagenuk MT-2000
            device from 1994</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">The oldest mobile game</h1>
        <p>In 1997, Nokia launched the very successful Snake.[3] Snake (and its variants), that was preinstalled in most
            mobile devices manufactured by Nokia, has since become one of the most played games and is found on more
            than
            350 million devices worldwide.[4] A variant of the Snake game for the Nokia 6110, using the infrared port,
            was
            also the first two-player game for mobile phones.

            Today, mobile games are usually downloaded from an app store as well as from mobile operator's portals, but
            in
            some cases are also preloaded in the handheld devices by the OEM or by the mobile operator when purchased,
            via
            infrared connection, Bluetooth, or memory card, or side loaded onto the handset with a cable.

            Downloadable mobile games were first commercialised in Japan circa the launch of NTT DoCoMo's I-mode
            platform in
            1999, and by the early 2000s were available through a variety of platforms throughout Asia, Europe, North
            America and ultimately most territories where modern carrier networks and handsets were available by the
            mid-2000s. However, mobile games distributed by mobile operators and third party portals (channels initially
            developed to monetise downloadable ringtones, wallpapers and other small pieces of content using premium SMS
            or
            direct carrier charges as a billing mechanism) remained a marginal form of gaming until Apple's iOS App
            Store
            was launched in 2008. As the first mobile content marketplace operated directly by a mobile platform holder,
            the
            App Store significantly changed the consumer behaviour and quickly broadened the market for mobile games, as
            almost every smartphone owner started to download mobile apps.[5]</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">which is the best mobile game in the world </h1>

        <p>The best game is Snowboarding at high speed has never been as relaxing as it is in Alto's Adventure. Very
            simple
            one-touch controls let you guide Alto (and several other unlockable characters) down the mountain while
            getting
            big air, grinding edges and performing multiple backflips.

            Beautiful endless mountain scenery, amazing day-to-night transitions and a mesmerizing soundtrack (you
            should
            definitely wear headphones) make this is a must have on any device.

        <p>PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds (PUBG) for mobile is a free survival shooter that lets you experience what
            it's like
            to be dropped on an island with 99 other players to see who will ultimately survive. But what's great
            about the
            mobile version of this extremely popular game on PCs is that it seems to run even better on a
            smartphone. In
            other words, this is one heck of a port.
            <img src="PUBG.jpg">

            Just like the original, you'll parachute in, loot buildings to gear up, and do your best to survive all
            the way
            to the end. You can go it solo, or create a squad of up to four players if you want to try out a team
            effort. Be
            careful though, this game is incredibly addicting. </p>
        <p>The sequel to Alto's Adventure is called Alto's Odyssey and -- while the original is still amazing -- the
            follow-on might be even better. You get a new trick to add to your arsenal with wall rides, making it
            possible
            to have more control over your combos. There are new environments to explore and you can you play a Zen
            Mode
            that lets you just take in the sights and sounds of the game.

            If there is any game you download from this list, Alto's Odyssey is extremely easy to recommend.</p>

        <h2>REVIEWS ABOUT ALTO ADVENTURE:</h2>

        <p>Endless runners are two-a-penny these days. From Madagascar penguins to treasure-hunting adventurers, it
            seems
            everyone has one. But rarely are they as beautiful or as atmospheric as Alto’s Adventure. The basic premise
            is
            the same as the rest: stay on the path for as long as possible, collect objects, avoid obstacles and
            complete
            goals as they’re set.

            But the path in this case is a snowy mountain, and the objects you need to collect are runaway llamas. There
            are
            coins to collect too, and points to rack up, but your main objective is to round up the runaway llamas while
            trying to stay upright on your snowboard. The surrounding environment is both beautiful and deadly. Weather
            changes as you move, bathing you in sunshine one minute, in a snowfall and worse the next. And the day time
            shifts too – while the course is reasonably easy to navigate in the midday sun, it’s more treacherous at
            night.
            Rocks appear from nowhere, chasms seems wider. You can also throw a few tricks in there to help boost your
            speed
            – check out the length of your scarf as you back flip – and your points total. That extra speed boost is
            handy
            for making it over some of the wider chasms and ravines. Fall in and your run is done. Points can also be
            earned
            by grinding on opportune bits of scenery, such as bunting.

            Looks-wise, it’s a bit Monument Valley, so you’ll spend half your time looking at the beautiful sunset or
            the
            sun-drenched mountainside rather than paying attention to the task at hand. It’s further proof, if it was
            needed, that mobile games can hold their own aesthetically.</p>
